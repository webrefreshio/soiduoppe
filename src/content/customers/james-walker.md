## Transparency You Can Trust

Finding a mechanic you can trust is hard. I've had bad experiences in the past with upselling and surprise charges. When my brakes started making noise, I was hesitant to go to a shop.

### A Different Experience

From the moment I walked into Copperlane, it was different. They inspected my brakes and sent me a digital report with photos showing exactly what was worn and what was still good.

### Clear Communication

They didn't just tell me I needed new brakes; they showed me why. They gave me a clear estimate with no hidden fees. I knew exactly what I was paying for before they started any work.

### Peace of Mind

The work was done quickly, and the car feels safe again. It's a relief to have a shop I can rely on for honest advice and quality work. I'll definitely be back for my future maintenance needs.
