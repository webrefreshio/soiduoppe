## Keeping Our Fleet Moving

Managing a delivery fleet means downtime is not an option. Before we switched to Copperlane, we struggled with unpredictable repair times and vague communication from other shops.

### The Challenge

Our vans are on the road 12 hours a day. We needed a partner who understood that every hour in the shop is lost revenue. We were facing:

- Inconsistent maintenance schedules
- Unexpected breakdowns
- Slow turnaround times

### The Solution

Copperlane implemented a proactive fleet maintenance program for us. They track our mileage, schedule services during our downtime, and provide detailed health reports for each vehicle.

### The Result

Since partnering with Copperlane, our unexpected breakdowns have dropped by 80%. We know exactly when vehicles need service, and they are back on the road faster than ever. It's a partnership that pays for itself.
