## Why Winter Prep Matters

| Cold Weather Challenge    | Our Solution                    |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Hard starting             | Battery test + fresh oil        |
| Poor traction             | Tire rotation + pressure check  |
| Reduced visibility        | Wiper inspection + washer fluid |
| Longer stopping distances | Complete brake inspection       |
| Freezing coolant          | Antifreeze protection test      |

## Winter Driving Tips

After your service, keep these tips in mind:

1. **Keep your gas tank at least half full** – Prevents fuel line freeze
2. **Carry an emergency kit** – Blanket, flashlight, jumper cables
3. **Allow extra stopping distance** – Ice can appear where you least expect it
4. **Clear all snow from your vehicle** – Including the roof!
5. **Warm up your engine briefly** – 30-60 seconds is sufficient for modern vehicles

## Best Time to Schedule

We recommend getting your Winter Safety Package:

- **Late fall** – Before the first freeze
- **After storing a vehicle** – If it sat unused during summer
- **Before long winter trips** – Holiday travel preparation

_Don't get caught in the cold. Schedule your Winter Safety Package before temperatures drop._
