## Why the 60,000 Mile Service Matters

Your vehicle's 60,000-mile mark is one of the most critical maintenance milestones. At this point, many components that have been working hard since day one are due for inspection or replacement. Ignoring this service can lead to decreased performance, poor fuel economy, and expensive repairs down the road.

## What We Inspect & Replace

### Engine Components

- **Spark Plugs** – Worn plugs cause misfires and reduce fuel efficiency
- **Air Filter** – A clogged filter restricts airflow and hurts performance
- **PCV Valve** – Ensures proper crankcase ventilation

### Fluid Services

- **Full Synthetic Oil Change** – Fresh oil with a new filter
- **Transmission Fluid Check** – Inspected and topped off as needed
- **Coolant Inspection** – Tested for proper freeze/boil protection
- **Brake Fluid Check** – Moisture content analyzed for safety

### Safety Inspection

- **Brake Pad Measurement** – Remaining life assessment
- **Tire Condition & Tread Depth** – Safety and wear evaluation
- **Suspension Components** – Checked for wear and damage
- **Belt & Hose Inspection** – Looking for cracks, wear, and aging

## Benefits of This Package

1. **Prevent Major Repairs** – Catching issues early saves money
2. **Restore Performance** – Fresh components mean better response
3. **Improve Fuel Economy** – Clean filters and fresh fluids optimize efficiency
4. **Maintain Resale Value** – Documented maintenance increases your vehicle's worth
5. **Peace of Mind** – Know your car is safe and reliable

This package is ideal for:

- Vehicles approaching or at the 60,000-mile mark
- Cars that haven't had major service in the last 30,000 miles
