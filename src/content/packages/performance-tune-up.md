## Restore Lost Power & Efficiency

Over time, carbon buildup, worn spark plugs, and clogged filters rob your engine of performance. Our Performance Tune-Up addresses these issues, restoring the responsive acceleration and fuel efficiency your vehicle had when it was new.

## What's Included

### Ignition System

- **Spark Plug Replacement** – Premium plugs matched to your engine
- **Ignition Coil Inspection** – Checked for proper output
- **Spark Plug Wire Check** – Resistance tested (if applicable)
- **Timing Verification** – Computer-controlled timing confirmed

### Fuel System Service

- **Fuel Injector Cleaning** – Removes carbon deposits
- **Throttle Body Service** – Cleaned for smooth airflow
- **Intake Valve Cleaning** – Removes buildup affecting airflow
- **Fuel Filter Inspection** – Replaced if restricted

### Air Intake System

- **Performance Air Filter** – High-flow replacement
- **Mass Airflow Sensor Cleaning** – Critical for fuel mixture
- **Intake Manifold Inspection** – Checked for vacuum leaks
- **PCV System Check** – Proper crankcase ventilation verified

### Engine Diagnostics

- **Full Computer Scan** – All modules checked for codes
- **Live Data Analysis** – Real-time performance monitoring
- **Oxygen Sensor Test** – Fuel mixture feedback verified
- **Emissions Readiness** – Confirmed for inspection compliance

### Oil Service

- **Full Synthetic Oil Change** – Premium oil for peak performance

## Performance Gains You'll Notice

| Area              | Before             | After               |
| ----------------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| Acceleration      | Sluggish, hesitant | Crisp, responsive   |
| Idle Quality      | Rough, uneven      | Smooth, quiet       |
| Fuel Economy      | Decreased MPG      | Restored efficiency |
| Cold Starts       | Hard starting      | Immediate firing    |
| Throttle Response | Delayed            | Instant             |

## Signs You Need a Tune-Up

Watch for these symptoms:

1. **Reduced fuel economy** – Filling up more often
2. **Sluggish acceleration** – Missing that zip
3. **Rough idle** – Engine shakes at stops
4. **Hard starting** – Takes multiple tries
5. **Check engine light** – Often ignition or fuel related
6. **Failed emissions test** – Common cause is tune-up items

## The Science of Engine Efficiency

Modern engines rely on precise air-fuel mixtures:

- **14.7:1** – The ideal stoichiometric ratio
- **Spark timing** – Must fire at exactly the right moment
- **Airflow** – Unrestricted breathing means more power
- **Fuel delivery** – Clean injectors spray in perfect patterns

When any of these are compromised, performance suffers. Our tune-up addresses all four factors.

## Recommended Tune-Up Intervals

| Spark Plug Type | Interval      |
| --------------- | ------------- |
| Copper          | 30,000 miles  |
| Platinum        | 60,000 miles  |
| Iridium         | 100,000 miles |

_Note: Other tune-up items should be checked every 30,000 miles regardless of plug type._

## Who Benefits Most

This package is ideal for:

- Vehicles with 50,000+ miles since last tune-up
- Cars experiencing decreased performance
- Drivers wanting to improve fuel economy
- Vehicles that failed emissions testing
- Anyone who loves that "new car" feeling
