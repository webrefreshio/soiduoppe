| ----- | ----------------- | --------------------------------------- |

## Why High-Mileage Oil Matters

Standard oil doesn't account for the wear patterns in older engines. High-mileage formulations include:

1. **Seal Conditioners** – Rejuvenate hardened gaskets and seals
2. **Higher Viscosity Additives** – Compensate for worn tolerances
3. **Enhanced Detergents** – Clean decades of buildup
4. **Anti-Wear Compounds** – Protect worn surfaces

## Keep Your Vehicle Running Forever

Many vehicles today can easily reach 200,000, 300,000, or even more miles with proper care. The key is:

- **Regular maintenance** – Don't skip services
- **Address issues early** – Small problems become big ones
- **Use appropriate products** – High-mileage formulations matter
- **Listen to your car** – New noises mean something
