## Why Protect a New Car?

Many people think new cars don't need protection. The truth is:

| Threat          | Without Protection       | With Protection        |
| --------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| UV Rays         | Paint fades in 2-3 years | Stays vibrant 5+ years |
| Bird Droppings  | Etches into clear coat   | Wipes off easily       |
| Water Spots     | Bonds to surface         | Beads and rolls off    |
| Interior Stains | Permanent damage         | Easily cleaned         |
| Resale Value    | Decreased                | Preserved              |

## The Science Behind Ceramic Coating

Ceramic coatings create a molecular bond with your paint:

1. **Surface Preparation** – Paint is decontaminated and polished
2. **Coating Application** – Liquid ceramic applied in controlled environment
3. **Curing Process** – Chemical bond forms with clear coat
4. **Final Inspection** – Every panel verified for complete coverage

The result is a permanent protective layer that can only be removed through abrasion.

## Maintenance Requirements

To maintain your protection:

- **Wash regularly** – Every 2 weeks recommended
- **Use pH-neutral soap** – Harsh chemicals can degrade coating
- **Avoid automatic car washes** – Brushes can scratch
- **Annual inspection** – We'll check coating condition

## Investment Comparison

Consider the math:

- **Paint correction later**: $500-1,500
- **Interior deep cleaning**: $200-400
- **Lost resale value**: $1,000-3,000
- **New Car Protection Package**: $499

_Protecting your car now costs far less than restoring it later._

## Best Time to Apply

- **Within the first month** of ownership
- **Before the first winter** – Salt and sand protection
- **Before a road trip** – Maximum protection for your journey
