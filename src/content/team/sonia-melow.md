bio: |
  Sonia Melow leads Copperlane's front-of-house team, making sure every driver understands their estimate, options, and timeline. She turns complex repair notes into clear updates that build confidence rather than confusion.

  Sonia runs our follow-up program, checking in after service visits, capturing feedback, and routing insights back to the shop floor. She also trains the team on empathy-driven communication so issues are resolved before they become complaints.

  With a background in service BDCs, Sonia is obsessed with quick responses and setting expectations customers can rely on.
