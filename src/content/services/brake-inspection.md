## Your Safety Starts with Your Brakes

Brakes are the most critical safety system in your vehicle. A thorough inspection can identify problems before they become dangerous—or expensive.

## Warning Signs You Need a Brake Inspection

- **Squealing or squeaking** – Wear indicators are touching the rotor
- **Grinding noise** – Pads are worn down to metal
- **Vibration when braking** – Warped rotors or uneven pad wear
- **Soft or spongy pedal** – Air in the brake lines or fluid leak
- **Pulling to one side** – Uneven brake wear or stuck caliper
- **Warning light** – Brake system or ABS light illuminated

## What We Inspect

### Brake Pads & Shoes

We measure thickness and check for even wear patterns. Most pads should be replaced when they reach 3-4mm.

### Rotors & Drums

We check for scoring, warping, and minimum thickness. Damaged rotors reduce braking efficiency and can be dangerous.

### Brake Fluid

We test fluid condition and level. Brake fluid absorbs moisture over time, reducing its boiling point and effectiveness.

### Calipers & Hardware

We inspect for leaks, proper movement, and corrosion that could affect performance.

### Lines & Hoses

We check for cracks, leaks, and deterioration that could cause brake failure.

## Brake Maintenance Schedule

| Component   | Inspection         | Replacement         |
| ----------- | ------------------ | ------------------- |
| Brake pads  | Every 12,000 miles | 25,000–70,000 miles |
| Brake fluid | Annually           | Every 2 years       |
| Rotors      | With pad changes   | As needed           |
