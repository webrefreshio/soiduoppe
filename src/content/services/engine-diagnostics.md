## Decode Your Check Engine Light

That little light on your dashboard could mean anything from a loose gas cap to a serious engine problem. Our advanced diagnostics take the guesswork out of car trouble.

## Common Reasons for Check Engine Lights

- **Oxygen sensor failure** – Affects fuel economy and emissions
- **Catalytic converter issues** – Expensive but critical for emissions
- **Mass airflow sensor** – Impacts engine performance
- **Spark plugs or wires** – Causes misfires and rough running
- **Loose gas cap** – Simple fix, but triggers the light
- **EGR valve problems** – Affects emissions and performance

## Our Diagnostic Process

### 1. Code Reading

We connect to your vehicle's OBD-II port to retrieve all stored diagnostic trouble codes (DTCs).

### 2. Live Data Analysis

We monitor real-time sensor readings to identify abnormal patterns and intermittent issues.

### 3. Component Testing

Based on codes and data, we test specific components to confirm the diagnosis.

### 4. Visual Inspection

We physically inspect related systems for obvious damage, wear, or disconnections.

### 5. Detailed Report

You receive a clear explanation of the problem, repair options, and cost estimates.

## Why Professional Diagnostics Matter

Big-box auto parts stores offer free code reads, but a code is just the starting point. Without proper diagnosis, you might:

- Replace parts that aren't actually faulty
- Miss the root cause of the problem
- Waste money on unnecessary repairs
- Leave related issues unaddressed

## We Diagnose All Makes & Models

Our state-of-the-art diagnostic equipment works with:

- Domestic vehicles (Ford, GM, Chrysler)
- Japanese imports (Toyota, Honda, Nissan, Subaru)
- European vehicles (BMW, Mercedes, Audi, VW)
- Hybrid and electric vehicles

## After the Diagnosis

Once we identify the issue, we'll provide you with:

- A clear explanation in plain language
- Repair options from budget to premium
- Transparent pricing with no surprises
- Priority scheduling if repairs are urgent
