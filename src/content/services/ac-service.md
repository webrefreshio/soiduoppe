## Stay Cool All Summer Long

A properly functioning A/C system isn't just about comfort—it's essential for safe driving. A hot cabin can cause driver fatigue and reduced concentration, putting you and your passengers at risk.

## Signs Your A/C Needs Service

- **Warm air blowing** – The most obvious sign of A/C trouble
- **Weak airflow** – Even on max settings, air barely comes out
- **Strange odors** – Musty or moldy smells from the vents
- **Unusual noises** – Clicking, rattling, or squealing when A/C is on
- **Water stains** – Puddles inside your vehicle under the dashboard

## Our A/C Service Includes

1. **System pressure test** – We check high and low side pressures
2. **Leak detection** – Using UV dye and electronic detectors
3. **Refrigerant recharge** – R-134a or R-1234yf as required
4. **Compressor inspection** – Checking for wear and proper operation
5. **Belt and hose check** – Ensuring all connections are secure
6. **Cabin air filter replacement** – For fresh, clean air

## How Often Should You Service Your A/C?

We recommend an A/C performance check:

- **Annually** before summer begins
- **Immediately** if you notice reduced cooling
- **Every 2 years** for a full system inspection

## Pro Tip

Run your A/C for at least 10 minutes once a week, even in winter. This keeps the seals lubricated and prevents refrigerant leaks.
