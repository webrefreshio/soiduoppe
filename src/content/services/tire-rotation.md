## Extend Your Tire Life by Thousands of Miles

Tires don't wear evenly. Front tires handle steering and absorb more impact, while rear tires follow along for the ride. Regular rotation ensures even wear, saving you money and keeping you safe.

## Why Rotate Your Tires?

- **Even tread wear** – All four tires last the same amount of time
- **Better handling** – Consistent grip on all corners
- **Improved fuel economy** – Balanced tires reduce rolling resistance
- **Maintained warranty** – Most tire warranties require regular rotation
- **Safer driving** – Predictable performance in all conditions

## Rotation Patterns

### Front-Wheel Drive

Front tires move straight to the rear. Rear tires cross to the front.

### Rear-Wheel Drive

Rear tires move straight to the front. Front tires cross to the rear.

### All-Wheel Drive

Typically an X-pattern where all tires cross sides and swap front/rear.

### Directional Tires

Front and rear swap on the same side only.

## Our Service Includes

1. **Tire inspection** – Checking for damage, wear patterns, and tread depth
2. **Rotation** – Moving tires according to manufacturer recommendations
3. **Pressure check** – Inflating all tires to proper PSI
4. **Balancing** – Eliminating vibrations for a smooth ride
5. **TPMS reset** – Recalibrating your tire pressure monitoring system

## When to Rotate Your Tires

| Driving Style        | Rotation Interval       |
| -------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Normal driving       | Every 5,000–7,500 miles |
| Aggressive driving   | Every 3,000–5,000 miles |
| Off-road/heavy loads | Every 3,000 miles       |

_Pro tip: Rotate your tires every other oil change to make it easy to remember._

## Signs You Need a Rotation

- Uneven wear visible on tire treads
- Vehicle pulling to one side
- Steering wheel vibration
- Increased road noise
- It's been more than 7,500 miles since the last rotation

## Don't Forget Wheel Alignment

If your tires show uneven wear even after rotation, you may need a wheel alignment. We can inspect and advise during your rotation service.
