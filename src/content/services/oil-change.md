## Why Regular Oil Changes Matter

Oil is the lifeblood of your engine. Over time, it breaks down and becomes contaminated with dirt, debris, and metal particles. Without regular changes, this degraded oil can cause:

- **Increased engine wear** – Metal-on-metal friction damages critical components
- **Reduced fuel efficiency** – Dirty oil makes your engine work harder
- **Overheating** – Old oil loses its cooling properties
- **Complete engine failure** – In severe cases, neglected oil can destroy your engine

## Our Oil Change Process

1. **Drain old oil** – We completely remove all used oil from your engine
2. **Replace oil filter** – A new filter ensures clean oil circulation
3. **Add premium oil** – We use manufacturer-recommended grades
4. **Check fluid levels** – We top off other essential fluids
5. **Multi-point inspection** – We examine belts, hoses, and filters
